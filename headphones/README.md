# Headphones Landing Page

This is a responsive landing page built entirely with **HTML5** and **CSS3** as part of the ALX Software Engineering program. The goal is to reproduce a high-fidelity design from Figma, implementing pixel-perfect accuracy, responsive layout, and accessible markup — all **without using JavaScript or external CSS frameworks**.

## 📄 Project Description

This webpage represents the official landing page of a fictional headphones company. It features:
- A clean hero section
- A showcase of smiling professionals
- Tutorials
- Membership plans
- FAQ
- Footer with social media links

All layout and styling decisions follow the design provided by **Nicolas Philippot (UI/UX designer)** in Figma.

## 🖼 Figma Design
